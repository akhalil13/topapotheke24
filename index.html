<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<big>Anxiety is not a new thing to us all and, in reality, everyone
needs to feel anxious at times because of this natural emotion the body
produces a reaction that releases adrenaline - the hormone stimulant
that we have into our bodies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Adrenaline is vitally important in encouraging us to take on difficult
and unpleasant tasks, assisting us to deal with stressful situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our lives appear to be controlled by moving from one emotional issue to the next. it is often thought to be normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is another reason that food that is in good health must be a part
of everyone's daily regimen, as it helps our immune system to deal with
the strain and stress put to our systems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The majority of anxiety sufferers have been a result of something we
know about - for instance, the upcoming exam or an important interview
, etc and creates different amounts of stress based on the person.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It can be a problem when fear or anxiety is felt in the absence of a
reason, or when the situation is deemed to be to be more hazardous than
is necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The way we handle it all depends on the individual and their perspective on life and personality.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While anxiety is a state of mind physical symptoms can also be caused
due to anxiety. It was previously thought that the symptoms were just
'in the mind'. However, it has been proved that some individuals
actually suffer from pain and eventually become sick because of the
negative effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The most commonly reported symptom is obviously the need to frequently
urinate, which I am sure that we have all had, I certainly have prior
to flying.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The most commonly reported sign of chronic anxiety is discomfort in the
back, the chest, head and abdomen. A few sufferers experience nauseas
and even vomit. Dizziness, diarrhoea and muscle tension are other
common issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In extreme instances, panic attacks may occur that typically involve
sweating profusely as well as palpitations, and unusually deep
breathing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For some sufferers with chronic conditions, it's a constant cycle.
Patients can be stressed out about having anxiety or have recurrent
attacks which can be experienced over years. This is referred to as
chronic anxiety. In these instances, medical attention is required.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sleepiness is another well-known side consequence, and this can only
increase the stress experienced by those suffering from it as they
contemplate the issue that causes anxiety, and making the smallest of
issues appear to be like a major obstacle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The most effective way to help your body to cope and maintain your
health in good shape is to ensure that you are eating healthy food. A
diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables, raw as well as salads and
lots of protein will provide you with an ideal balance and will help in
keeping your immunity in top shape.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Carrots, in particular, the juice of carrots is believed to possess an
uplifting effect over the body's nervous system. The camomile tea is
another one that is a fan favorite.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A variety of vitamins are thought to aid in healing, Vitamins B and C
are believed to aid in the battle against stress and <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/air-pollution-may-trigger-anxiety-symptoms/">anxiety</a>, as well
as the function of central nervous systems is thought to be improved by
Vitamin E along with magnesium, calcium and zinc minerals.<br />

<br />
<br />
Another self-help option to beat anxiety is to practice breathing
exercises. Breathing exercises that are controlled can will help you
relax and calm. If you try Visualisation Therapy which I utilize for
relaxation, you'll discover how simple to utilize and how it has
remarkable effects on your life and your perspective on your life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many who are suffering from anxiety are prone to dwell on worries and
issues that make them sick rather than being optimistic and this is a
problem that must be dealt with. Make an effort to adopt an optimistic
mindset and show kindness to yourself, however, ensure that you don't
get over indulgent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Chocolate is a great food with a wonderful feel, and a bit of your
favorite flavor is beneficial, and is drinking a glass of juice help
lift your spirits. However, making use of this as a crutch or consuming
too much is not without its own consequences.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aromatherapy is another great way to boost your mood, and we all know
that nice scents can boost your mood Essential oils can be an excellent
method to achieve this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A blend of sandalwood, lavender, basil and clary sage can assist in
reducing anxiety and panic However, if you have a headaches due to
anxiety, or muscle tension, add marjoram and camomile essential oils.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Try using these oils on a burner while taking a refreshing bath to relieve yourself of the stress of your day.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Music is a excellent method to help us to relax. Why not listen to some
music on your private stereo, or an MP3 while waiting for an
appointment or other event that makes you feel nervous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Music that we like generally improves our mood and sometimes , by
listening to natural sounds such as whales, water and the like can have
a positive impact.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The root to your stress is crucial in order to ease the burden and
discussing your concerns with a trusted friend could be very
beneficial. In more serious cases, psychiatrists can provide assistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that our outside perspective on life actually can aid or worsen
our battle with anxiety all through our lives. by eating a balanced
diet for healthy living and maintaining an optimistic mindset can aid
in fighting the signs and maintain a strong immune system that keeps
our bodies in top health<br />
